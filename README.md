# Project overview

This project is aiming to build a prediction model for water potability given a set of measurements of its content.

## Dataset

**Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nayanack/water-probability

This dataset contains information about various factors affecting water quality. It includes measurements of pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, turbidity, and potability of water samples.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/repository_name.git
```

2. **Install UV**

If you're a MacOS/Linux user type:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

If you're a Windows user open an Anaconda Powershell Prompt and type :

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

3. **Create an environment**

```bash
uv venv
```

3. **Activate the environment**

If you're a MacOS/Linux user type (if you're using a bash shell):

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

If you're a MacOS/Linux user type (if you're using a csh/tcsh shell):

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate.csh
```

If you're a Windows user type:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
